# APPractice-Version-1-Seedly-
Final project from my CS Capstone course (HS Senior Year, Sept 2024 â€“ June 2025) â€” originally titled Seedly. A full-stack web app for AP students to practice multiple-choice questions across various subjects and units. Built with React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Firebase, and Gemini API.
