# APPractice - Version-1: Seedly

This project was my final for the CS Capstone Course (HS Senior Year, Sept 2024 â€“ June 2025), originally titled Seedly.
Itâ€™s a full-stack web app designed for AP students to practice multiple-choice questions across various subjects and units.
Built with React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Firebase, and Gemini API for AI-generated quizzes.

I forgot to upload this project last year ðŸ˜… - these files have remained unmodified since I last worked on them in June 2025, so a few things in the code may no longer work as intended. I plan to improve and rework this project in the future.
